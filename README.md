# Humble-Projects
This is my first, hopefully of many Data Science projects, albeit a guided one from DataCamp. The first project, 'Handwashing_Discovery' reviews the data a Physicist in Venice used back in the later half of the 19th century, to argue that not washing hands was the primary reason why many new mothers were dying soon after giving birth.
